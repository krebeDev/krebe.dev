## About this project

This project is my solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) challenge.
I developed it with vanilla JavaScript. And pulled in the countries data from the
[Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) RESTful API endpoints.

<br />
With the style guide and the designs provided, the task was to build the project
to fulfil the requirements below.

<br />

**A user should be able to:**

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
