## About this project

Wavy is a file-sorting app that uses dates from a file's metadata to generate a visual timeline.

This project is teamwork, and is built with ReactJs. We adopted IndexedDB for client-side storage of user files.

<br />I was responsible for the initial setup of the workspace as well as
deployment to Github pages.{' '}

I also created and composed components for file upload from user machines and utilities to format and
save files to the database.

<br />I had practical experience in team dynamics and learnt how to be a great
team player. I also benefited greatly from our code review sessions. Each
session provided insights on different ways to approach a coding challenge.{' '}
