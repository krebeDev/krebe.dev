## Project overview

In today's web development landscape, overall performance is supreme. That is where static site generators
like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) shines. It was my first encounter with Gatsby, so I spent a few days digging into the docs to
understand how the APIs fit together. I particularly like the powerful GraphiQL tool that exposes the GraphQL
data layer. It made organizing and piping data into the website a breeze.

## The challenge

Designing the UI was a mix of hurdles and fun. I did some UI/UX research and took
clues from [Behance](https://behance.com/) and [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/). Narrowing it down,
I checked out some developer portfolio websites and got
inspirations from [caferati.me](https://caferati.me/), [giftegwuenu.com](https://www.giftegwuenu.com/),
[taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/) and [Overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/).
With the bits and pieces in place, I made the design with Adobe XD.

## Creating the site

The first thing I did after scaffolding the app was to organize the structure of the project directory.
I wanted the site to be up in the shortest possible time.
The high points for me making this site is the little form validation.
There are features I will include in subsequent iterations.

## Technical summary

Here are the tools and technologies I got involved with while building this website.
