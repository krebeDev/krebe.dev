## Project overview

I joined the [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) voyage program in the first quarter of 2020.
This case study is a pre-work solo project that enabled me access to the program.

I built the web app with ReactJs and connected the frontend to the
[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) to fetch the queries for books.

I persisted user data in local storage to simulate a conventional bookshelf organization.

The highlights of this work revolved around accessibility, error handling, responsiveness,
and effectively handling API response on the client while presenting returned data in a consumable format.

## Technical Summary

Here are the tools I used on this project.

- ReactJs
- Styled Components
- Google Books API
