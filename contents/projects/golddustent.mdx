## About this project

The client wanted a 'Coming Soon' page with instructions on how the site visitors can participate in an
upcoming Talent Show. However, I suggested they needed a landing page at a minimum for that purpose.

<br />
We settled for WordPress because they intend to manage their content in-house with
a familiar CMS in the future. I used the lightweight Astra theme and sliced custom
HTML and CSS to reduce bloating and improve performance.

## Technical Summary

These are the tools I used on this project.

- Wordpress
- HTML5
- CSS3
