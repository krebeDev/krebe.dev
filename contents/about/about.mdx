Hi there!

<br />

My name is Solomon and I am a frontend developer with over 4 years of professional experience.
I have a strong passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications.

<br />

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have been working in the tech industry for the past 4+ years.
Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, including developing
responsive websites, creating interactive applications using modern JavaScript frameworks, and optimizing website performance.

<br />

I have a working experience in a variety of frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript,
React.js/React Native, and Vue.js. I am also familiar with design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite
and Figma. In addition to my technical skills, I have excellent problem-solving
and communication skills, which have allowed me to work effectively with cross-functional
teams and deliver high-quality products.

<br />

Over the years, I have consistently met project deadlines and delivered products
that exceeded client expectations. I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with
others to create innovative solutions.

<br />

Outside of work, I am an avid learner and am always looking for ways to improve my
skills and stay up to date with the latest technologies. I also enjoy swimming and a
daily gym routine to stay fit.
