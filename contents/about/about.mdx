Hi, my name is Solomon Ekrebe. I'm a Frontend Developer based in Abuja, Nigeria.

I have a strong passion for clean UIs. And love creating scalable websites and mobile
apps with a focus on accessibility.

<br />

I started my tech career in 2017 as a freelance WordPress designer.
But it was not until 2019 that I switched to Frontend Development after taking
refresher courses on Responsive Web Design, Advanced Programming Concepts and
Data Structures / Algorithms.

<br />

I've spent the past year building and maintaining [KindleNG](https://kindle.ng/),
a utility bill payment application. Working on this project got me deeply immersed in the
React(JS/Native) ecosystems.

<br />

Before diving into tech, I served as a Transaction Officer in a commercial bank. I often
tackle coding from a risk perspective. And by the way, I still wear a suit and a tie
to the office sometimes:-

<br />

In my spare time, you'll find me playing Peppa Pig games with my 3-year-old daughter;
or enjoying the thrills of an action-packed crime/investigative movie.
I also love hip hop music and swimming in temperate water.
